## estimating pi using Buffon's needle

If we draw horizontal lines with distance 2 on a piece of paper and drop needles of length 1 on the paper, we can get an estimation of pi!
Pi is estimated by dividing the total number of needles by the number of needles which intersect our horizontal lines.

The more needles we drop the closer we get to pi!
