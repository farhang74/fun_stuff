## fun_stuff

A series of fun scripts regarding fun math equations written in python.

Over the years I've gained a lot of interest in strange and fun equations in math for example fractals, mandlebrot set, fibonacci sequence, the golder ratio and ...

In this repo we'll be exploring some of them in python.

hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did

more stuff coming soon...
